# Loxim
My own implementation of the Lox programming language, from the awesome book "Crafting interpreters" by Robert Nystrom.

Loxim stands for "Lox improved", because it's basically Lox with a few more features.

Right now, everything that has been implemented is:

* The VM. (Even thought it's not complete)
* The Scanner (it's complete!)
* Currently implementing the parser/compiler.
